Panel for the Wavepainter adaptor PCB by Plum Audio. 

I built this after ordering a alu panel for the Wave2 from Pusherman and then getting bored of waiting for it to be delivered. Spacing on the holes is a little innacurate compared to the official panel, but not enough to effect construction so I wont be editing it.

Status: Good enough.
